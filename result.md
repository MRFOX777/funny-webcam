## About This project
The idea of this project came from a class that everyone uses their webcam to test AR works. It looks so funny that they tried different angles to get the AR objects shown but fail. This made me think, "What if there's really nothing gonna show up?" People easily follow rules without thinking why, so I decided to build a fake webcam mask website and shifted the functions of two main buttons "Run" and "Rest", which secretly takes screenshots.   

### 1. Be Confused 
The two buttons are perfectly malfunctioned, so the users got confused and sanded their screenshots to me, asked why it doesn't work.

Actually if scroll down you can see what happens.

### 2. Get into a Panic
Some are smarter and find something wrong of this website, then they were astonished the endless screenshots and tried pressing "Reset" to stop it. Of course, it doesn't work!!!!! Only press "Run" can stop the website.
Like this guy, he had kept taking screenshots for over 5 minutes and still didn't know why, neither stop it XD

BTW I didn't build the mobile version, but it still can runs on <b>Android phones</b> (but it fails on iPhone)
Here is the screenshots, still funny huh?
