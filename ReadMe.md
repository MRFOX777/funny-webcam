## About This project
The idea of this project came from a class that everyone uses their webcams to test AR works. It looks so funny that they tries different angles to get the AR objects shown but fail. This made me think, <b>"What if there's nothing gonna show up?"</b> 

People easily follow rules without thinking why, so I decided to build a <b>fake</b> webcam masks generator using [Webcam.js](https://pixlcore.com/read/WebcamJS)(open webcam and take screenshots) and[tracking.js](https://trackingjs.com/)(webcam face tracking), then I <b>shifted the functions of two main buttons "Run" and "Rest"</b>, which secretly <b>takes screenshots</b>. The simple glitch would challenges what we used to think of user interface and buttons.

### Step 1. Be interested
Please allow webcam!!!

### Step 2. Be Confused 
Since the two buttons are perfectly malfunctioned, so the users got confused and sent their screenshots to me, asked why it doesn't work.

Actually if <b>scroll down</b> you can see what happens.

### Step 3. Get into a Panic
Some are smarter and find something wrong with this website, then they were astonished by the endless screenshots and tried pressing <b>"Reset"</b> to stop it. Of course, it doesn't work!!!!! <b>Only press "Run" can stop.</b>

Like this guy, he had kept taking screenshots for over 3 minutes and still couldn't figure out why, neither stop it XD

BTW I didn't mind the mobile version, but it still can runs on <b>Android phones</b> (it fails on iPhone)

## Debug version
I also built a lighter [debug version](https://uglykiki.github.io/funny-webcam/debug.html) and modify some functions, such as webcam filter and glitch. 

Press "Run" then you will see a repeated glitch.
